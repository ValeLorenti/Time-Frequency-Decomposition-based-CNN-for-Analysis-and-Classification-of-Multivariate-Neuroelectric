# Time Frequency Decomposition based Convolutional Neural Networks for Analysisa and Classification of Multivariate Neuroelectrical Signals


The Dataset_Factory and [x29] Datase_Factory files are used to generate images from the signals. The remaining files are useful for classifying these images using both Deep Learning and Machine Learning (used as a baseline).
